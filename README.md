# ExplorDataAnalysis_proj1
This directory is project #1 for Exploratory Data Analysis course from Coursera.com
There are 8 files in this directory, including 4 plots and 4 R code files for generating the plots.

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” from 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.  

The descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are shown below:

    Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
    Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
    Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
    Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
    Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
    Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
    Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
